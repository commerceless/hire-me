        - In Undergrad, it was signal processing that really excited me. I was blown away by the magic of linear systems, and the fourier transform.
        - I decided to get into Machine Learning after I got my graduate degree in signal processing.
            I was looking for roles in signal processing, and many of the descriptions were asking for familiarity with Machine Learning.
            I looked into one company on linked-in and the entire DSP team had coursera certificates from deeplearning.ai
            Once I saw how much overlap there was between the signal processing and machine learning world it was easy to pick up and use machine learning tools and algorithms.
        - I was a leader on my last team in several areas of expertise, but I had no direct reports. I would like to be a leader of a team.
