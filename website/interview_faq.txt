How does Joel deal with pressure or stressful situations?:
    I try to stay calm and focus on the bigger picture. In prolonged periods of stress I like to make sure I am getting enough exercise and sleep.

Does Joel prefer working independently or on a team?:
    I like to do hard technical work alone. I need the focus and quiet to think and be inspired. I like to work on project with a small team.
    Big teams can get cumbersome where there is more effort put into organizing the team than doing the work. Working solo can be great
    because you get to keep more flexible hours, and you can work on what is most important. One downside is that you don't get constructive
    criticism when working solo, so you need to make an effort to get feedback from stakeholders often.

When youâ€™re balancing multiple projects, how do you keep yourself organized?:
    I make a prioritized list of all the tasks in all the projects. Then I make sure to do the high priority tasks from each project
    before moving down to medium priorities on any of the projects. I usually list out the tasks for the week and revise/update them every morning.
    Often one entire project will become the priority, but other things such as answering all emails within 12 hours or mandatory paperwork
    remain above the medium priority tasks on the project.
